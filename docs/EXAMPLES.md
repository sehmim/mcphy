## What Makes These Examples Interesting

### üß† **Smart Parameter Extraction**
MCPhy understands natural language and extracts structured data:
```
"Create booking for John Doe for oil change for 2025-01-15"
‚Üì
{
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "service_type": "oil change", 
  "appointment_date": "2025-01-15"
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Information Detection**
When you ask incomplete questions, MCPhy helps:
```
You: "create booking"

MCPhy: ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing required fields:
       ‚Ä¢ garage_id (e.g., "for garage way/123456")
       ‚Ä¢ customer_name (e.g., "for John Doe")
       ‚Ä¢ service_type (e.g., "for oil change")
       ‚Ä¢ appointment_date (e.g., "for 2025-01-15")
```

### üîå **Real API Calls**
MCPhy doesn't just match queries - it makes actual HTTP requests:
```
You: "get all users"
MCPhy: üì§ GET http://your-api.com/users
       üìã Response: [{"id": 1, "name": "John"}, ...]
```
